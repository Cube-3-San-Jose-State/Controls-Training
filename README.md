## :thinking: Project Ideas
Now that you have gained knowledge and skills in Arduino, device interfacing, protocols, and version control, here are some project ideas to apply what you have learned:

1. **CubeSat Orientation Indicator:** Build a CubeSat model with a servo motor-controlled arrow that indicates the orientation of the CubeSat based on data from the MPU6050 IMU sensor.

2. **CubeSat Sun Tracker:** Develop a CubeSat model with servo motors that adjust solar panels to track the position of the sun using data from the MPU6050 IMU sensor.

3. **CubeSat Stability Experiment:** Create a CubeSat model that uses servo motors to maintain stability by counteracting external disturbances based on readings from the MPU6050 IMU sensor.

4. **CubeSat Motion Logger:** Build a CubeSat model with servo motors that record and log the detected motion and rotation data from the MPU6050 IMU sensor.

5. **CubeSat Attitude Visualization:** Develop a CubeSat model with servo motors that visually represents the detected attitude and orientation based on data from the MPU6050 IMU sensor.
