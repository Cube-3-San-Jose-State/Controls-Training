## :thinking: Project Ideas
Now that you have gained knowledge and skills in Arduino, device interfacing, protocols, and version control, here are some project ideas to apply what you have learned:

1. **CubeSat Orientation Indicator:** Build a CubeSat model with a servo motor-controlled arrow that indicates the orientation of the CubeSat based on data from the MPU6050 IMU sensor.

2. **CubeSat Sun Tracker:** Develop a CubeSat model with servo motors that adjust solar panels to track the position of the sun using data from the MPU6050 IMU sensor.

3. **CubeSat Stability Experiment:** Create a CubeSat model that uses servo motors to maintain stability by counteracting external disturbances based on readings from the MPU6050 IMU sensor.

4. **CubeSat Motion Logger:** Build a CubeSat model with servo motors that record and log the detected motion and rotation data from the MPU6050 IMU sensor.

5. **CubeSat Attitude Visualization:** Develop a CubeSat model with servo motors that visually represents the detected attitude and orientation based on data from the MPU6050 IMU sensor.

Feel free to choose a project that interests you the most or come up with your own unique idea. Remember, the goal is to apply your knowledge, learn from the experience, and have fun along the way!
